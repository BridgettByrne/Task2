    <p class="wrapper">Her Excellency, the Almighty Narukami Ogosho, who promised the people of Inazuma an unchanging Eternity.
        The Raiden Shogun is a firm believer of what she believes to be eternity—a place in which everything is kept the same, regardless of what goes on. She is honorable in her conduct and is revered by the people of Inazuma
        The Raiden Shogun exists in two forms—Raiden Ei, her true identity, and the Shogun, a puppet created by Ei to act as the ruler of Inazuma in her stead while she meditates in the Plane of Euthymia.
        This puppet follows a set of directives programmed into her, which are extremely hard to modify even by Ei herself.
        The Shogun is cold and stern in personality, even callous at times; she is limited in emotional expression, has no likes and dislikes, and has no need for recreation.
        The Shogun thinks of herself as Ei's assistant,and does exactly as she wishes, no more and no less; she cannot act without Ei's direction, and if her usual functions are disabled, the Shogun becomes incapable of doing anything.
        Due to her limited protocols and Ei's initial indifference for anything other than her goal of eternity, the puppet can easily be manipulated by outside forces.
        For example, the Kujou Clan and the Fatui tricked her into initiating and maintaining the Vision Hunt Decree.</p>
